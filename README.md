# Estimating Ground Truth in a Low-labelled Data Regime: A Study of Racism Detection in Spanish
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/487601308.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/487601308)

This repository contains the code for the paper submitted to 1st Workshop on Novel Evaluation Approaches for Text Classification Systems on Social Media ([NEATCLasS](https://neatclass-workshop.github.io/)).

Our paper investigates the impact of different ground truth estimation methods on a model for racism detection. The experiments are organised as follows: 
- The first notebook implements the ground truth estimates ([Ground Truth Estimation](./1_annotations_aggregation.ipynb)).
- The second notebooks assess the annotation problem due to the few labels and high disagreement ([Annotation Assessment](2_annotation_assessment.ipynb)).
- The last notebook evaluates the performance and error analysis of the models trained on different estimates  ([Impact Evaluation on Racism Detection](/3_racism_detection_model.ipynb)).

Most annotators may not have previous experience with racism, as only three belong to the Black community. Our empirical results show better performance at lower thresholds for classifying messages as racist, which may be due to the propagation of permissiveness in annotating racist messages to the model.

## Installation

The BcnAnalytics team is working for the release of the data. We will add the [link]() to the data repository here âŒ›

Please copy the `evaluation_sample.csv` and `labels_racism.csv` to the data folder!

To run our code, pip install the packages in `requirements.txt`.

Then, you are ready to go for generating all the analysis outputs from our paper using the jupyter notebooks. We describe your resulting project directory tree below ðŸ‘‡
